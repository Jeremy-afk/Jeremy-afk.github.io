# Lecture Homework 3: Final Project: Evaluating the locomotion technique

We performed evaluation on in total 3 participants. And they are finished in total 3 rounds. The results are as follows.

## Round 1

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 35       | 100          |
| 2      | 91       | 85           |
| 3      | 36       | 94           |

## Round 2

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 33       | 90           |
| 2      | 80       | 86           |
| 3      | 32       | 70           |

## Round 3

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 32       | 96           |
| 2      | 82       | 90           |
| 3      | 36       | 92           |

## Average

Time per round: 54s, 48s, 50s

Accuracy: 93%, 82%, 93%

## Survey Results

We surveyed the participants' **motion sickness level**, **difficulty to complete task**, **virtual presence**, **enjoyment** using a Likert scale.

User 1 (shown in the demo video we recorded) got used to the mechanics really quickly and was able to operate smoothly. And he has give us good feedback on most of the items.


User 2 is relatively slow in learning the mechanics. She thinks that "the sensitivity of the accelerating stick makes it really hard to move forward". She struggled a lot with it.


User 3 also got a good hold of the game mechanics pretty quickly. He reported that in general the schema of driving is fun but it wasn't really enjoyable to ascend/descend using the buttons on the joysticks.



Here is the detailed results:

| Player  | Motion Sickness | Ease to play | Virtual Presence | Enjoyment |
| :------ | :-------------- | :----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1       | 1               | 8            | 9                | 8         |
| 2       | 3               | 5            | 10               | 6         |
| 3       | 2               | 7            | 8                | 8         |
| Average | 2               | 6            | 9                | 7         |
