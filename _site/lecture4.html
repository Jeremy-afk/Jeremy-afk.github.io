        <h1 id="lecture-homework-4-final-project-locomotion-ideation-prensentation">Lecture Homework 4: Final Project: Locomotion Ideation Prensentation</h1>
<p>The slides for the presentation can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XjsfyYwi1pgFntuuZDpUeb4SaRPNmTiiA-euwgHa2ks/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

<p>The locomotion technique we are going to implement is Steering Wheel.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Our idea is inspired from a very classic karting game: Mario Kart since we are doing race car.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: Mario Kart</p>

<p><img src="Images\Lecture4\mario.jpg" alt="Alt text" title="Mario Kart" /></p>

<p>But since we are in a VR game setting, we wanted to give user more freedom in exploring some of the settings. Hence, we also borrowed from the game I expect you to die, which is a virtual reality puzzle game.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: I expect you to die
<img src="Images\Lecture4\to-die.jpg" alt="Alt text" title="I expect you to die" /></p>

<p>The user will be place in a cabin to start. Situated in a virtual vehile, the user can see two hands/gloves where their joysticks are pointing at. They can use those to manipulate a steering wheel and an accelarator stick.</p>

<p>The expected interface should look as follows:
<img src="Images\Lecture4\interface.jpg" alt="Alt text" title="Virtual vehicle" /></p>

<h2 id="advancing">Advancing</h2>
<p>We ruled out the option to turn based on the direction the user is facing because that would cause too much motion sick especially when the user is making sharp turns.</p>

<p>Instead, the vehicle will turn according to user’s manipulation of the steering wheel. They can change the direction and speed by grabbing the accelerator stick.</p>

<h2 id="jumping">Jumping</h2>
<p>One of the tasks was the collect coins in the sky. 
To accomplish that, we will put a eye-catching band on the track to remind user to jump. Regardless, the user will have the freedom to jump at any point they want to trial-and-error.
There will be a “jump” button where the horn usually is. And the car will ascend in the sky once the button is pressed. Who knows, maybe it will also make a funny horn sound.</p>
