# Lecture Homework 2: Final Project: Locomotion Ideation Prensentation

The locomotion technique we are going to implement is Steering Wheel.

## Setup
Our idea is inspired from a very classic racing game: Mario Kart. 

**Inspiration**: Mario Kart

Since we are in a VR game setting, we wanted to give user more freedom in exploring some of the settings. Hence, we also borrowed from the game I expect you to die, which is a virtual reality puzzle game.


**Inspiration**: I expect you to die

The user will be place in a cabin to start. Situated in a virtual vehicule, the user can see two hands/gloves where their joysticks are pointing at. They can use those to manipulate a steering wheel and an accelarator stick.

The expected interface should look as follows:

## Advancing
We ruled out the option to turn based on the direction the user is facing because that would cause too much motion sick especially when the user is making sharp turns.

Instead, the vehicle will turn according to user's manipulation of the steering wheel. They can change the direction and speed by grabbing the accelerator stick.

## Jumping
One of the tasks was the collect coins in the sky. 
To accomplish that, we will put a eye-catching band on the track to remind user to jump. Regardless, the user will have the freedom to jump at any point they want to trial-and-error.
There will be a "jump" button where the horn usually is. And the car will ascend in the sky once the button is pressed. Who knows, maybe it will also make a funny horn sound.
