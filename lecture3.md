# Lecture Homework 3: Final Project: Evaluating the locomotion technique

We performed evaluation on 3 participants. Each round corresponds to a third of the track.

## Round 1

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 30       | 100          |
| 2      | 34       | 100           |
| 3      | 63       | 60           |

## Round 2

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 35       | 95           |
| 2      | 45       | 75           |
| 3      | 75       | 80           |

## Round 3

| Player | Time (s) | Accuracy (%) |
| :----- | :------- | :----------- |
| 1      | 30       | 100           |
| 2      | 38       | 90           |
| 3      | 50       | 94           |

## Average

Time per round: 42s, 52s, 39s

Accuracy: 86%, 83%, 93%

## Survey Results

We surveyed the participants' **motion sickness level**, **difficulty to complete task**, **virtual presence**, **enjoyment** using a scale graded from 1-10. 

Here is the detailed results:

| Player  | Motion Sickness | Handling | Virtual Presence | Enjoyment |
| :------ | :-------------- | :----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1       | 3               | 4            | 10               | 8         |
| 2       | 3               | 5            | 10               | 6         |
| 3       | 5               | 7            | 8                | 6         |
| Average | 3.6             | 5.3          | 9.3              | 6.6       |
