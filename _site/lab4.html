<p>The resulting application may seem small but we can not understate the time it took to debug everything. A lot of hair pulling sessions had to happen in order for this lab to come to fruition.</p>

<h2 id="1--headset-setup">1- Headset setup</h2>
<p>The first step was to setup the VR headset so that it is in “developper mode”. The recipe is as follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the Meta Horizon app on your phone.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are connected to the same wifi network as the headset.</li>
  <li>Activate bluetooth and localisation.</li>
  <li>To get the phone to actually connect to the headset is still a bit mysterious. I’ve found sucess in activating “mirror mode”  which allows you to see what is happening in the headset. When deactivated you should be connected to the headset.</li>
  <li>You also need a Meta developper account, luckily it is not very hard to setup and you only needs to confirm an email address.</li>
  <li>You may now activate “developper mode” in your headset.</li>
</ul>

<em>The meta horizon app</em></p>

<h2 id="2--unity-setup">2- Unity setup</h2>
<p>You need developper mode in order to send data from unity and to execute “unidentified apps” which are the builds of the project you are working on. The steps I took may not be the most effective ones but they were the result of trial and error.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Unity Asset store get the following packages: Meta XR Simulator, Meta Interaction SDK and Meta XR Core SDK.</li>
  <li>Along with the previously mentionned packages, I imported the XR plugin management, XR interaction toolkit and XR hands.</li>
  <li>Switch the build profile to android and make sure to select the headset as the run device.</li>
  <li>In project settings make sure that the in Player/Minimum API level is high enough to be compatible with the packages you installed.</li>
  <li>In XR Plug-In Management select the OpenXR Plug-In Provider.</li>
  <li>You may now import the features you need.</li>
  <li>One part the I struggled with a lot is getting the controllers working. I found a sample project in the XR Interaction Toolkit package called “Hands Interaction Demo”. There is a demo scene that shows a lot of different interactions and most importantly the controllers work. So I snatched prefabs and put them in my scene.

<em>Hands demo Scene</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3--game-creation">3- Game creation</h2>
<p>Since I was starting from a blank project, I wanted to try something new. I took inspiration from a traditionnal carnival game called “Chamboule-tout”. You have knock down a pile of cans from a distance by throwing a ball.</p>

<p>The can is a simple cylinder game object with a rigidbody and a box collider. I setup the mass to be a little bit lighter than the ball so they can satisfyingly fly when they get hit.</p>

<p>To create the ball you can add a rigidbody to a sphere game object and add the XR Grab Interactable component. The component allows the ball the be grabbed and thrown.</p>

<p>As the video shows, the ball can be grabbed by a great distance and thrown quite far. Because of this you can just move the ball around to knock the cans (which is cheating) but still very fun to do.</p>
