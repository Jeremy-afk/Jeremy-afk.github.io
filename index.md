This blog post was born on 2nd of december, a sunny day, despite our first piece of content already created one week ago, not a sunny day.
In [**Lab 2**](./lab2.html), the great Unity magician Geremy (I thought it matches with the filename Gem) created a coin collection game with Unity to kickstart our amazing project !
